# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on the project space and structure. Decided brushing up on CMake, so I am preparing build script.

**Thoughts:** I am not really sure if preparing the project counts toward "coding", but it is an important part of any software project so I will act like it is.

## Day 2: March 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added logging ability using spdlog library

**Thoughts:** It was a long day and I am quite tired. I will sto for today, as the code is running circles in front of my eyes.
